## Rollback 
Roll back to a specific commit in the published repository.  If you want to commit on top of the current HEAD with the exact state at a different commit, undoing all the intermediate commits, then you can use `reset` to create the correct state of the index to make the commit.

    # Reset the index to the desired tree
    git reset 56e05fced
    # Move the branch pointer back to the previous HEAD
    git reset --soft HEAD@{1}
    git commit -m "Revert to 56e05fced"
    # Update working copy to reflect the new commit
    git reset --hard


## make npm global user writable rather than force a sudo all the time
`sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local`
